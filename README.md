# British-Airways-Reviews

This project is a part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage with British Airways.

The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks:
Web scraping to gain company insights and
Predicting customer buying behaviour

Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights
Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for British Airways was collected from Syntrax.

Task 2 - Predicting customer buying behaviour
Customers are more empowered than ever because they have access to a wealth of information at their fingertips. This is one of the reasons the buying cycle is very different to what it used to be. Today, if you’re hoping that a customer purchases your flights or holidays as they come into the airport, you’ve already lost! Being reactive in this situation is not ideal; airlines must be proactive in order to acquire customers before they embark on their holiday.

This task involves building a high quality predictive to predict the successful bookings using customer bookings data.
