# British-Airways-Reviews

This project is a part of the Data Science virtual internship program offered by Forage with British Airways.

The virtual Internship is divided into two main tasks:
Web scraping to gain company insights
Predicting customer buying behaviour

Task 1 - Web scraping to gain company insights
Customers who book a flight with BA will experience many interaction points with the BA brand. Understanding a customer's feelings, needs, and feedback is crucial for any business, including BA.

This first task is focused on scraping and collecting customer feedback and reviewing data from a third-party source and analysing this data to present any insights you may uncover.

Customer review data for Britis Airways was collected from Syntrax.
